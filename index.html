 <!-- 2:11:45 is where he talks about psiturk with jsPsych  

psiturk.js doesn’t actually “exists” as a file in the static folder of any project. 
Instead, the psiturk server/command line tool automatically generates this file. 
The best way to view it is by “view source” in your browser while debugging your experiment. 
While somewhat unintuitive, this ensures that changes to psiturk.js are linked to new versions 
of the overall psiturk command line tool (since they are tightly interdependent)


/*
 * psiturk.js Requires:
 *     jquery
 *     backbone
 *     underscore
